## Part 1

## Part 2

- At first thought that copies of cards didn't get copied again, would have been too easy
- Dynamic programming recursion problem!
- Similar to fibonacci dynamic programming
- What the final 20% that took 80% was this time: forgetting to add +1 after summing the number of copies created (eg. Card 3 should have a value of 4 - 3,4,5,5). That combined with not realizing I was off by one because I was taking the whole total of all the cards took a lot of time...
