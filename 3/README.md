# 3

# Part 1

- Using a set vs an array
- Moving to looping over the numbers instead of the symbols
- Not finding numbers with symbol to left? parseInt is culprit
- Issue with case 467++114..
- Building HTML to figure out where I messed up...
- Difference between my best guess and the answer I got 10+ hours later? 21. Did I miss parsing a 21? Was it somehow invalid? I have no clue...

# Part 2

- Agonizingly straightforward compared to the troubles I was having with the previous part
- Still looking around the numbers in all directions
- New Map for all potential gears and add each number with an adjacent potential gear around it to that map gear location
